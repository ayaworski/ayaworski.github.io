            I defined the vision, roadmap, and execution for a three-week design

            scalable payments solution. I reframed the problem, aligned
            cross-functional partners, and established the foundation to scale
            B2B payments into a long-term growth initiative.

            <p>
              The legacy payments experience was fragmented, manual, and
              disconnected, limiting supplier adoption and constraining business
              growth. Low automation, limited payment methods, and an outdated UI
              eroded confidence and prevented scale.

            I reframed the challenge as an opportunity to learn directly from our
            users. Instead of focusing on immediate delivery, the initiative
            became a strategic foundation for future work. Checkout served as a
            lens to uncover opportunities, validate assumptions, and shape
            long-term product direction, shifting the focus from fixing a
            checkout to designing a scalable end-to-end payments experience.

          <p>
            We ran a three-week design spike to rapidly turn ambiguity into a
            clear vision. A small, cross-functional team defined goals,
            constraints, and success criteria, then used high-fidelity prototypes
            to test assumptions, uncover insights, and align stakeholders on the
            path forward.

          <h3>Cross-Functional Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            Twice-daily check-ins and design reviews ensured visibility,
            reinforced accountability, and aligned decisions with both user and
            business needs. This approach allowed partners to anticipate
            challenges, de-risk constraints, and streamline downstream
            development.

            The design spike was successful in clarifying the problem space,

            user insights. Testing revealed where we could iterate quickly,
